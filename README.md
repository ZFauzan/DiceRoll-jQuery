# DiceRoll-jQuery
Created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, this project is an interactive dice roll game of two players that generates a random number for each player and declares victory to the player with the greater number, or draw game if both players roll the same number. This project implements some key Javascript features such as generating random numbers, sound, and animation upon the user clicking on an image while also adhering to responsive web design principles.
